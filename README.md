This project is a simple Movie Recommendation System built in Python. The system allows users to input their preferred movie genre (such as Sci-Fi, Action, Adventure, or Romance) and recommends a list of movies based on the selected genre.

Key Features:
Input-Based Recommendations: Users can enter a genre, and the system returns a list of recommended movies that match their selection.
File Logging: Each user interaction is logged in a recommendations.txt file. This file keeps track of the genres selected by users and the corresponding movie recommendations provided. Each entry in the log includes:
The genre selected by the user.
A list of recommended movies.
Workflow:
User Input: The user selects a genre.
Movie Recommendation: The system searches for movies in that genre from a predefined list.
File Logging: The recommended movies are written to the recommendations.txt file with details about the user's choice.
Command Line Output: The recommendations are also printed in the terminal.
